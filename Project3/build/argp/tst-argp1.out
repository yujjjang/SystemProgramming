Usage: tst-argp1 [OPTION...]

 This is a test for threads so we allow ther user to selection the number of
 threads which are used at any one time.  Independently the total number of
 rounds can be selected.  This is the total number of threads which will have
 run when the process terminates:
  -s, --starts=NUMBER        Total number of working threads
  -t, --threads=NUMBER       Number of threads used at once
      --toplevel=NUMBER      Number of toplevel threads which start the other
                             threads; this implies --sync-join

 Each thread can do one of two things: sleep or do work.  The latter is 100%
 CPU bound.  The work load is the probability a thread does work.  All values
 from zero to 100 (inclusive) are valid.  How often each thread repeats this
 can be determined by the number of rounds.  The work cost determines how long
 each work session (not sleeping) takes.  If it is zero a thread would
 effectively nothing.  By setting the number of rounds to zero the thread does
 no work at all and pure thread creation times can be measured.
  -c, --workcost=NUMBER      Factor in the cost of each round of working
  -r, --rounds=NUMBER        Number of rounds each thread runs
  -w, --workload=PERCENT     Percentage of time spent working

 There are a number of different methods how thread creation can be
 synchronized.  Synchronization is necessary since the number of concurrently
 running threads is limited.
      --sync-join            Synchronize using pthread_join
      --sync-signal          Synchronize using a signal (default)

 One parameter for each threads execution is the size of the stack.  If this
 parameter is not used the system's default stack size is used.  If many
 threads are used the stack size should be chosen quite small.
  -g, --guardsize=BYTES      Size of stack guard area; must fit into the stack
  -S, --stacksize=BYTES      Size of threads stack

 Signal options:
      --to-process           Send signal to process (default)
      --to-thread            Send signal to main thread

 Administrative options:
  -p, --progress             Show signs of progress
  -T, --timing               Measure time from startup to the last thread
                             finishing

  -?, --help                 Give this help list
      --usage                Give a short usage message

Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
for any corresponding short options.
